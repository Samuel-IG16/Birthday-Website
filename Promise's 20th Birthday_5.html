<pre>Though at the moment
we are poles apart.
In my thoughts, in my actions
you are in my heart...

Each moment i think of you
tho you are not near.
Here comes my wishes
to pray for you, my dear...

In your life ahead
may all your dreams come true.
And you learn something
special and new...

May your worries
all fade away.
And every happiness
embrace you each day...

May you always get
love and peace of mind.
And togetherness with
the one of your kind...

May your each day ahead
end with a bliss.
And what's more,
with a good night kiss...

Yet another year,
now has passed.
Giving you the wisdom
little and vast...

Nineteen years
have fallen.
Next many and more
in a row are aligned...

Wishing you a very
Happy birthday my soul mate...
<hr>
  A wish for lots of birthday fun
To last until the day is done.
Hoping that all your wishes come true,
and your birthday cake is as sweet as you.
<hr>
Another year has passed
A birthday for you is in store
May you find this coming year
Be one with lots of open doors.
</pre>
