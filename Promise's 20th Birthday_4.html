        <h2>Restrospect</h2>
        <h5>On the 3rd of October 2017, i graduated from Edo college. I can still remember that day
      like it was yesterday and like many of my collegues would, i believe i hold that day special
      on many accounts. Need i say i just finally concluded Secondary School; i was a recipient to
      quite a number of awards; My family and friends were present and of course Promise was there.
      I can still remember how it all played out, although in fragments now. The Human memory has a
      funny way of recollecting events, especially old events. That's why i try as much as possible
      to document special moments worth recalling upto the minute and simplest details. Trust me they
      help paint a more accurate picture even as you reflect on them. So where was i in my story? ahhh
      yes! Promise came to my graduation. As it was the custom then, graduants were meant to march into
      the hall at the opening ceremony. The atmosphere was humid, with clear skies. I remember dressing
      up that morning. I was feeling weird didn't know what to expect and yet i expected alot from that
      day. I remember entering the school premises in my aunt's car, with my parents. So we were told to
      go get our graduation gowns and queue up in front of the hall.  All this while i was expecting to
      see her. I was just about to take the left turn into the hall when i saw her coming from my right
      i was so excited to see her, i can almost compare the feeling to that of a groom at the site of his
      bride walking down the aisle (laughing out loud). She wore majorly red, and for me i knew whatever
      happens inside the hall wouldn't really matter, the fact she was there made my day complete.
      It's been two years, a month, some few days.
